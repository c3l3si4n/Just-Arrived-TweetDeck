# Just-Arrived-TweetDeck

Just Arrived TweetDeck is a simple extension that helps you stop scrolling through the same tweets mindlessly. Infinite scrolling has wasted many hours in our lives and "Just Arrived" tries to save some of that time from ourselves.

This extension was adapted from tecoholic/Just-Arrived, for working with TweetDeck. 

Just install the plugin. That's all. Every-time you visit TweetDeck home page, it records the tweets that you have scrolled through the month and dims it the next time you visit Twitter.

No data is harvested, no information ever leaves your browser. Plus it gets cleared every month.
